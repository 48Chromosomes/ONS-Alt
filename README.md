# Census Atlas

Explore neighbourhood-level Census data tables on a map.

## State ownership

In this app, there are three 'owners' of state:

- URL (app state)
- Map instance (transitory map state, eg exact zoom and position)
- Svelte components (transistory, local UI state, eg a [details](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/details/) component)

All *important* state flows in one direction from the URL to the UI. This is a fundamental principle of web design and UX on the web. It enables link sharing and makes apps work on the web. 

- When a URL is shared, the app opens in the same state as when it was shared *in every important way*
- The Back (and Forward) buttons should work completely correctly
- Embedding is a special case of sharing - again, the URL needs to contain all the relevant state needed to show the embeddable content

## URL structure

    /population/sex/default/female          ? msoa=E02006827
                    |                               |
                    |                               |    
    /topic/variable/classification/category ? geotype=geocode
                    |                               |
          `path` picks a node                `query` selects
          in the content tree                 the geography
